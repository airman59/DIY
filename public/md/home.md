##Wellcome

This is my experiment-site while trying to create a SPA using Node.js,
Express.js, MongoDB and ES6. No frameworks, JQuery or Bootstrap ;-)

It's just a hobby-project for my own learning. I will retire in a few month
and don't need to earn any more money so productivity isn't important at all :-)

The site is hosted on a node.js-droplet at [DigitalOcean](href="https://www.digitalocean.com/), so far I'm happy with
that solution. Presently I have my own installation of a mongoDB there. It's easy to log in with SSH and manage both
the server and the database.

I test things in Google Chrome Version 54.0.2840.71 (64-bit) and node.js v6.7.0 locally.
Server-version of node is v4.4.5 so for the time being I'm using my "old" ES5-server online.

The content is fetched from the DB as markdown and converted to html with [showdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/showdown).
It's then fecthed by the client with AJAX.
