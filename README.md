# DIY

Trying to build a SPA-application using MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js and
the present status of ES5/ES6 in modern browsers. 
A live example can be found at [kingsislet.com](http://www.kingsislet.com).

The repository is for my own version-control.

## Requirements

* node (v6.7.0)
* npm (v3.10.3)
* mongodb (v3.2.7)

And a few config-files not included in the repository at this stage.

## License

## ToDo

- A better code structure before adding more routes/functions to the client.

##History

*   20161208: Introduced custom events to handle the result of the ajax-requests.
*   20161207: Login with JWT added.
*   20161130: Skipping system.js and ES6-modules.
*   20161126: Simple routing and highlighting in navbar.
*   20161117: Moved AJAX-functions and navbar to separate files/modules.
*   20161116: Quick test fetching content from DB with AJAX.
*   20161112: Starting project and repository.
