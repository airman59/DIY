# DIY

Trying to build a SPA-application using MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js and

The repository is for my own version-control.

## Requirements

* node (v6.7.0)

- After reading up a bit on ES5-modules and namespaces I have implemented a
  new version of of the site. Now it's a single global object and modules in
  separate files that adds public functions to the global.

implemented in todays browsers.
